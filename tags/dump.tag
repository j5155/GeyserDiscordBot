Run `geyser dump` in your server console or `/geyser dump` in ingame chat on your Geyser instance or server, then copy the link it will give you and paste it below this message. A Geyser dump is a way of providing us with useful information about your server and Geyser config. This doesn't include any IPs or sensitive data.

If you use the Geyser Standalone GUI, it is inside the `Commands` menu as seen below.
